# android_maps_api_restful_interface
A demo of the new project I am working on for Android, using MySQL, PHP, and Java/Android Studio. The project uses a user registration system and allows users to add and review businesses.

This project interacts with the PHP code in the maps_api_restful_interface_backend repository, and needs a web server to interact with. I used WAMP,
but there are plenty of others.
