# android_maps_api_restful_interface
A demo of the new project I am working on for Android, using MySQL, PHP, and Java/Android Studio. The project uses a user registration system and allows users to add and review businesses.

This project interacts with the PHP code in the maps_api_restful_interface_backend repository, and needs a web server to interact with. I used WAMP, but there are plenty of others. 

The IP address in the Android files that connect to the server need to be updated to the server address that you will be using.
